Contributor's Guide
===================

Welcome to the Contributor's Guide for UXarray!

So, welcome to the team! If you are reading this document, we hope that
you are already or soon-to-be a UXarray contributor! Please keep reading!

Overview
--------

UXarray is a community-owned, open-development effort that is a result
of the collaboration between `Project Raijin <https://raijin.ucar.edu/>`_
and DOEâ€™s `SEATS Project <https://seatstandards.org/>`_ ]. Even though the
Uxarray team has initiated and been expanding this package, outside
contributions are welcome and vital for its long-term sustainability.
Therefore, we invite other community members to become part of this
collaboration at any level of contribution.
