    "UXArray `SpatialHash` class provides an API for locating the unstructured grid faces that a list of $(x,y)$ points (in spherical coordinates) lie within. This search is conducted by relating unstructured grid faces and arbitrary physical positions to a uniformly spaced structured grid (the hash grid). The relationship between the unstructured grid elements and the hash grid is maintained in a hash table. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "The `SpatialHash` class can be accessed through the `Grid.get_spatial_hash(reconstruct)` method, which takes in the following parameters:\n",
    "* `reconstruct` is a bool variable that allows the user to reconstruct the spatial hash structure. As default for performance, if a user calls `get_spatial_hash` and a spatial hash structure has already been created, it will simply use that one. If `reconstruct` is set to `True`, it will override this and reconstruct the spatial hash structure. The default parameter is `False`.\n",
